  "description": "If you listen carefully to the squirrels and the moths, you hear rumors of a fierce feline warrior, with bizarre and terrifying abilities, trawling through the country side. They say he is searching for revenge.... or was it his banished master? ... perhaps a precious artifact?  unbound riches? an estranged kitten?  Oh well, wildlife makes terrible gossipers.  \n\nBesides, all you see before you is, by all accounts, a pretty ordinary cat.\n\n_____________FOREWORD_____________\nThe Cat's journey is a series of short installments created for an Original Character Tournament called \"War For Rayuba\", a nearly-year long event in 2021.  Participants were matched against other participating artists and competed to make the best comic over 9 rounds.  Deadlines for each match-up were typically between 2 - 3 weeks, and occasionally involved collaboration with other tournament participants.  The winning comic in each round is considered canon.  As not all of The Cat's stories were winners, as a result, not all the comics listed here are from his canon timeline.  These are marked by an X.\n\nThe Cat, Charon and Panra were created by Dande; The Cat's opponents and allies belong to their respective creators.  Round 6 and Round 9 were collaborations with other creators.  The rest are made by Dande.  \n\nThe universe in which the OCT takes place is set in Rayuba, a fictional location from the webcomic, Kill Six Billion Demons. Tensions in Rayuba between ordinary citizens and powerful individuals known as demiurges escalate to a war between two factions:  BASTION, which believes the world is worth saving despite its flaws, and PYRE, which seeks to annihilate the world and start from scratch.  Familiarity with the lore isn't necessary, but it does help.  \n\nRead K6BD here: https://killsixbilliondemons.com/\n\n____________________\ntwitter: @dandydande",
